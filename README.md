# azure-sphere-debug-examples

A repository for debugging examples based on the Azure Sphere

Recently I've been asked to help do some training on basic debugging skills.
I've done this in the past and the most effective classes included a lot of
hands-on debugging practice.  This repository will hold the hands-on debugging
practie examples.  And since I currently work on Azure Sphere, the examples will
be using Azure Sphere.
